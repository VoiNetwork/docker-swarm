# Voi Swarm

## About

This repository contains the installation script and configuration files for setting up a Voi node on a
Linux system.

Success criteria for the installation script are:

> 1. Offer easy ways for users to operate and maintain their nodes as healthy participants in the Voi network.
> 2. Provide a simple and easy way to onboard new participants.
> 3. The package should be as cheap as possible to run for individual participants.

To achieve this, the package is an opinionated way to join the network, and may thus not be suitable for
all use cases.

# Staking with Voi Swarm

Voi Swarm supports the Voi Staking program. To have your node participate with
the stake on your deployed contract, run Voi Swarm:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://get.voi.network/swarm)"
```

Voi Swarm will do the following for you:

- Automatically set up your node to participate in the staking program
- Manage participation keys required for the staking contract

Once your node is online, you can check the status of your staking contract
using the Voi Staking website, as well as choose any lockup periods applicable.

# Keeping Your Node Healthy

!!! info inline end "A healthy node is a happy node"
    We are working on improving the running experience by automating and simplifying as much as possible. Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vnFbrJrHeW) and provide your feedback!

To operate your node and manage your accounts, you can use the Voi CLI tools.
The Voi CLI tools is a bundle of commands
that allow you to manage common operation related to the network, as well as your setup.
The Voi CLI tools are installed with the Voi Swarm package.

As a participant, it's important that you continuously monitor the health of your node. This includes monitoring system
metrics, node health as well as ensuring participation keys are up to date.

# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Voi Swarm. Delighted to have you here :tophat:

Voi Swarm provides a straightforward entry to the Voi network. However, its opinionated design may not fit all use cases.
Before you get started with running a node, it is important to evaluate options and understand the requirements.

## What is Voi?

Voi is a community-owned and operated L1 blockchain and ecosystem.

Voi stands out
by uniquely allocating a majority of the ecosystemâ€™s resources to those who directly add value to the network.
It fosters decentralization, promotes self-governance, encourages community investment,
and simplifies the user experience to facilitate mainstream usage.

# Setting Up Your Account

For Voi Swarm to participate on the network, it is necessary to have Voi to stake on the network. This is done by setting
up a Voi account and a Voi wallet.

If you are not ready for this yet, do not worry as you can always install Voi Swarm and setup your account later.

## Setting Up a New Voi Account

To set up a new account, you need to install and use a wallet app. The wallet app will manage secure access
to your tokens and can be used for sending and receiving Voi.

## Adding Voi to Your account

Once your account and wallet app are set up, you can add Voi to your account by purchasing them on centralized exchanges or using a decentralized exchange.

### Buying Voi on a Centralized Exchange

To buy Voi on a centralized exchange, you will need to create an account on the exchange and then buy Voi using the
exchange.
After this is done, you can withdraw the Voi from the exchange to your own wallet and stake them on the network.

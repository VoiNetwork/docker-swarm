# Migrating to Voi Swarm

## From host-based based setups

Install Voi Swarm on your server by importing your existing wallet using your mnemonic:

```bash
export VOINETWORK_IMPORT_ACCOUNT=1
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://get.voi.network/swarm)"
```

=== "Installing on same server"

    During the installation, the setup will detect compatible AVM based setups on the same host and offer
    migration automatically.

    If you want to migrate manually after installation run this command:

    ```bash
    ~/voi/bin/migrate-from-host-setup
    ```

    This command will do the following steps for you:

    1. Duplicate telemetry settings, including existing telemetry name and GUID, without affecting rewards.
    2. Stop the host-based Voi and Algorand services
    3. Remove the Algorand debian package, to avoid conficts with the Voi Swarm setup
    3. Restart Voi Swarm

=== "Installing on a new server"

    To migrate your setup to a new server you must first install Voi Swarm on the new server using the
    [installation instructions](../installation/installation/#using-an-existing-accountaddress-with-mnemonic), after this
    you can migrate your existing setup by following these steps:

    1. Run the following command on the old server to get the telemetry name and GUID:

        ```bash
        sudo ALGORAND_DATA=/var/lib/algorand diagcfg telemetry status
        ```
    2. Copy the telemetry name and GUID to the new server.
    3. Run the following command on the new server to set the telemetry name and GUID:

        ```bash
        ~/voi/bin/set-telemetry-name <telemetry-name> <telemetry-guid>
        ```
